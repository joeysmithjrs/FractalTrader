# FractalTrader

Welcome to **FractalTrader**, an innovative open-source framework designed for algorithmic trading and research, focusing on the cryptocurrency market. This framework simplifies working with multiple time scales and managing a diverse trading universe, offering unparalleled ease in handling many assets.

FractalTrader is developed to fill gaps in existing open-source trading frameworks, particularly in handling varied time scales and extensive asset portfolios without the need for complex workarounds. 

FractalTrader embraces a distinctive methodology by viewing financial time series as dynamic systems with fractal geometric traits. To complement this approach, it offers a comprehensive, custom toolkit designed to assist in the development of advanced technical indicators and strategies. Furthermore, FractalTrader features native support for conformal prediction, integrating with the MAPIE library to provide model-agnostic and distribution-agnostic prediction intervals.
